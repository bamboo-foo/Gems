# Pillars of Islam

NOTE: This is more of an article/post.

### This did not begin as pillars but seems to be moving in that direction.

It is long, because it's meant as a conversation (especially with children) that detailed understanding. TODO: Put a TL, DR;

Concepts: 

- Zakat
- Hajj
- Mata
- Prayer

There once was a man on a secret mission, for in the Quran he had seen that Allah had spoke about life as a <i>"mata"</i>. As Islam grew the influx of culture started to quickly advance the meaning and usage behind words, and so he saught to find the real meaning behind the word mata.

So he went to the bedouin people, out into the desert. He didn't tell them why he was there, and rather than ask them what "mata" meant he wanted to see them use it so as to avoid any influence on him gleaming understanding of the word. So he just went to observe.

As he stayed amongst them he waited for them to say the word. Perhaps he enriched their lives as he patiently waited. He was on a quest to discover the meaning of life in a way, so all the while he remained quiet looking for this treasure. 

One day he noticed a girl playing by the riverside.
