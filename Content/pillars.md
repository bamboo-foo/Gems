# Pillars of Islam

NOTE: This is more of an article/post.

### This did not begin as pillars but seems to be moving in that direction.

It is long, because it's meant as a conversation (especially with children) that detailed understanding. TODO: Put a TL, DR;

Concepts: 

- Zakat
- Hajj
- Mata
- Prayer

There once was a man on a secret mission, for in the Quran he had seen that Allah had spoke about life as a <i>"mata"</i>. As Islam grew the influx of culture started to quickly advance the meaning and usage behind words, and so he saught to find the real meaning behind the word mata.

So he went to the bedouin people, out into the desert. He didn't tell them why he was there, and rather than ask them what "mata" meant he wanted to see them use it so as to avoid any influence on him gleaming understanding of the word. So he just went to observe.

As he stayed amongst them he waited for them to say the word. Perhaps he enriched their lives as he patiently waited. He was on a quest to discover the meaning of life in a way, so all the while he remained quiet looking for this treasure. 

One day he noticed a girl playing by the riverside. In her hands she held a doll, perhaps it was a horse. She was brushing the horses long hair with a hairbrush. 

## Outline  
> Remember it originally started and flowed as such:
1. Zaki meaning
2. Zakat meaning any good action that will result in you being purified.
3. Like why do we pray 5 times a day?
    a. The hadith: The prophet (AS) was asked, and pointed out the river in front of them. I question you reader: So think to yourself after you shower do you feel clean? 

    The prophet (AS) asked them if you were to bathe in the river 5 times a day would you ever really be dirty?

    So if you take 5 baths/showers in a day would you be dirty often? Not really right, and so in the prayer during sujood/rukhoo Allah (SWT) washes away our ill deeds, our sins.  
4. This wudhoo, washing, prayer are good deeds that clean away our sins. Even the hair brush from Mata (-- Rami ?Safan?), it is of use to you. This whole life is of use to you. To do good deeds even amongst difficulties and inclination or the challenge faced by overbeautification/showing off.

5. Did you know, during Hajj you can't cut your hair. You can't cut your nails. You can't hunt game to grow big and strong. The only other time when you are so restricted is death. -- The idea for this came from an incredible lecture on YouTube unfortunately I forgot for now must search it. 

6. There will come a time when people will be by Allah, after death, and after understanding the situation beg to be sent back so they can do good. These simple things like cutting your nails, cutting and brushing your hair can be seen as good deeds. 

7. So you must also do good deeds that clean your wealth. Perhaps because, in the accumulation of wealth like let's say you bought an electric car, with a really big battery to advance your business. And so thus you create wealth, and do much good by advancing an option and development of an alternative fuel and thus the improve the opportunity to achieve cleaner transportation in the future. But in the present, the battery's minerals are mined from somewhere, and likely people are suffering that live near the mining site. There water ways and access to resources may be polluted and cut off. They are marginilized in that they can't effectively lobby for protections of public resources. So perhaps Zakat is any good that will end up purifying you, and in terms of your wealth it is giving some back to the poor because they have a right to this portion of your money. 

8. Give while you are alive. Consider a whole date store after death, versus a simple crushed date while alive (hadith). Give while you can. 

9. The miracle of Hajj, we go back to Allah while being alive, we struggle with our lives, with our being, we try hard in our life. We constantly ingrain remembering Allah as we pass between Safa and Marwa, but we try and give efforts. Prayer and efforts. The effort is seeking help, shouting out for help; all while praying in dua to Allah (SWT). The miracle, where the baby had water.  and we come back to Arafah where  
10. We have a miracle, we come saying "Allah humma labaek". Allah we are here for you, we journey back to Arafah where Allah pulling our souls out from Adam (AS). Back to where we will be gathered on the plains after death. But here, in Hajj we have a miracle in that Allah allows us (Inshallah) to come back to life. He cleans our sins. He gives us a new birth, we cut our nails, shave our head and are sin free like a baby. We are not trapped like the others who after actual death cannot come back and give, cannot come back and do good deeds, cannot come back and smile, cannot come back and care for their health. 

11. So live, give. Strive and remember Allah. When you gain, give. And remember Allah. That's what this life is under temptation, diress, or goodness and ease to remember Allah, give, sacrifice and keep striving.

Hm.. maybe should try short chapters? Could detail like Don't you have a hairbrush?
