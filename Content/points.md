### Towards Eternity video

This video was about a woman who had reverted to Islam.

- Sufficient for the believer is to look up at the sky to know that Allah is there. (paraphrased, unsure whether hadith or a cultural saying)
- When his (AS) wives were upset the prophet (AS) would stay quiet. He (AS) would let them be emotional(I believe she said this was a hadith, TODO: find hadith source.)
